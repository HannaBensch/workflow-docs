# Running FastQC/MultiQC on reads

[FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) is a tool
that checks sequence reads for overall quality and various potential quality
problems and artefacts. It works at the level of samples and hence produces
one set of outputs per (pair of) sequence file(s).
[MultiQC](https://multiqc.info/) summarizes a set of FastQC files to give a
better overview of all the samples from a sequencing run.
